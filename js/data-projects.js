        <p>This is basically the website where my web development journey has started. Since there's not much technical stuff to talk about here, I'll let you with <span class="fs-i">its story:</span></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The story begins in February 2019 with me, as a very annoying and details obsessed person, who got almost everyday in the IT department room to one of the programmers, with a list of front-end changes to this website, begging him to help me change the CSS and HTML code.</p>
          <p>At some point, my coworker became so tired of me, that I asked him if he can let me do these changes by myself. He connected me to the server and soon afterwards the <a href="https://www.xprimm.com/" target="_blank">xprimm.com</a> portal had a new color-scheme, a sticky navbar with a search button, smooth shadows, rounded corners everywhere and a nice and legible typography on articles.</p>
          <p>Even now there are still many things to improve, but I belive the UX is at reasonable levels.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The website uses Bootstrap 2, a JavaScript scroller library and plain JavaScript.</p>

        <p>My second project at XPRIMM. It's a redesign of a really old website made which was made using old-school methods (HTML tables for layouts).</p>
        <p>I was so annoyed about the old website look that I decided it was time to start learning programming. Although it doesn't look impressive at all, it gave me a huge confidence boost, since I proved to myself that I can actually program.</p>
        <p>The technology stack is not monumental. I basically recycled the layout used on <a href="https://www.xprimm.com/" target="_blank">xprimm.com</a> (one of our websites, sort of 'my first project', where I saw for the first time ever how HTML, CSS and JavaScript look and behave together).</p>
        <p>The front-end of the website uses Bootstrap 2 (very old version for 2019 standards) and vanilla JavaScript (for header scrolling events and other visual tricks).</p>

        <p>My company was launching a new campaign for motor vehicle insurance and decided that we should launch a fresh looking website related these insurance products. The timeframe for it to be ready was really short (around 4 weeks), so I had to keep the things really simple and mobile responsive.</p>
